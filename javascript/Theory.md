## 1.What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for adding interactivity to web pages. It allows developers to create dynamic and interactive content that can respond to user actions, manipulate DOM elements, handle events, and communicate with servers.

## 2.What are the data types in JavaScript?
JavaScript has several data types:

Primitive data types: number, string, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol.
Non-primitive data type: object.
What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?

== is the loose equality operator, which performs type coercion before comparing two values. It checks for equality after converting both operands to a common type.
=== is the strict equality operator, which checks for equality without performing type coercion. It returns true only if both the value and the type of the operands are the same.

## 3.What are closures in JavaScript? Can you provide an example?
Closures are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables, even after the outer function has finished executing. They "remember" the environment in which they were created. Example:
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = 'I am from the outer function';
    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable);
    }
    return innerFunction;
}
const innerFunc = outerFunction();
innerFunc(); // Output: I am from the outer function


## 4.Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations. Example:
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 5;


## 5.What is the difference between null and undefined?

null represents the intentional absence of any object value.
undefined represents the absence of a value in a variable or property.
How does prototypal inheritance work in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, objects inherit properties and methods from other objects through their prototype chain. Each object has a prototype object from which it inherits properties. If a property is not found in an object, JavaScript looks for it in the object's prototype chain until it reaches the top-level object (Object.prototype).

## 6.What are the different ways to create objects in JavaScript?

Object literals: const obj = { key: value };
Constructor functions: function Person(name) { this.name = name; }
Object.create method: const newObj = Object.create(proto);
ES6 Classes: class ClassName { constructor() {} }
Explain event bubbling and event capturing in JavaScript.
Event bubbling is a mechanism in which events propagate from the innermost target element up to the outermost ancestor. Event capturing is the opposite, where the event is captured by the outermost element first and then propagated to the inner elements.

## 7.What is the difference between let, const, and var?

var is function-scoped and can be redeclared and reassigned.
let and const are block-scoped, and let can be reassigned while const cannot be reassigned.
Explain the concept of promises and how they are used in JavaScript.
Promises are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They allow asynchronous code to be written in a more synchronous-like manner, making it easier to manage. Promises have states (pending, fulfilled, or rejected) and can be chained using .then() and .catch() methods.

## 8.What is the purpose of using setTimeout and setInterval functions in JavaScript?
setTimeout is used to execute a function or evaluate an expression after a specified delay (in milliseconds). setInterval is used to repeatedly execute a function or evaluate an expression at fixed intervals.

## 9.Explain the concept of callbacks and provide an example of how they are used.
Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, which are then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of action. They are commonly used in asynchronous programming. Example:

javascript
Copy code
function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        const data = 'This is some data';
        callback(data);
    }, 2000);
}

function processData(data) {
    console.log('Processing data:', data);
}

fetchData(processData);
## 10.What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?

Synchronous code executes line by line and blocks further execution until the current operation is completed.
Asynchronous code allows the program to continue executing while waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete. It uses callbacks, promises, or async/await to handle asynchronous tasks.

## 11.What is JSON and how is it different from JavaScript objects?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format used for storing and exchanging data. It is based on JavaScript object syntax but is text only. JSON is a string representation of data, while JavaScript objects are actual data structures.

## 12.What is the purpose of the this keyword in JavaScript?
The this keyword refers to the context within which a function is executed and provides a way to access properties and methods of an object within that context.

## 13.What are arrow functions and how do they differ from regular functions?
Arrow functions are a concise way to write function expressions in JavaScript. They have a shorter syntax compared to regular functions and do not have their own this or arguments bindings.

## 14.Explain the concept of lexical scoping in JavaScript.
Lexical scoping means that the scope of a variable is defined by its location within the source code (lexically) and nested functions have access to variables declared in their outer scope.

## 15.What is event delegation and why is it useful?
Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is attached to a parent element instead of individual child elements. When an event is triggered, it bubbles up to the parent element, which can then handle the event. It is useful for handling events on dynamically created or large numbers of elements efficiently.

## 16.How do you handle errors in JavaScript?
Errors in JavaScript can be handled using try...catch blocks to catch and handle exceptions. Additionally, you can use throw to throw custom errors, and finally to execute code regardless of whether an error occurs or not.
